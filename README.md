# Modelling-Gene-Expression-using-non-linear-regression
 The aim of this analysis is to select the best regression model from a candidate set of nonlinear regression models that can best describe the relationship between several ‘simulated’ gene expression time-series data. Gene expression is one of the most important biological processes where information from a gene is used to synthesize a functional gene product, such as protein. The expression of a gene can be regulated by another gene or several other genes, through a gene product called transcription factor. Understanding how genes regulate each other is important to investigate a complex diseases, and how cell respond to environmental stimuli.
The data set gene_data.csv shows the simulated 5 gene expression time series. The first column contains the sampling time in minutes while the next 5 columns represents the time course expression data of 5 genes x1, x2, x3, x4 and x5 respectively. This 6 columns are without headers and each have 301(rows) entries in total. I assumed that the 5 genes are independent and identically distributed also Gaussian with mean(µ) equal to zero with unknown variance(σ).
