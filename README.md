# Modelling-Gene-Expression-using-non-linear-regression
 The aim of this analysis is to select the best regression model from a candidate set of nonlinear regression models that can best describe the relationship between several ‘simulated’ gene expression time-series data. Gene expression is one of the most important biological processes where information from a gene is used to synthesize a functional gene product, such as protein. The expression of a gene can be regulated by another gene or several other genes, through a gene product called transcription factor. Understanding how genes regulate each other is important to investigate a complex diseases, and how cell respond to environmental stimuli.
